    "Good day, dear Kagglers! I wrote this notebook as a kind of logical conclusion to the study of Kaggle micro-courses. It uses a variety of techniques to solve the Titanic problem from all the different Kaggle micro-courses for beginners. You can simply familiarize yourself with this notebook and find those topics that, in your opinion, are worth repeating (i will give all the links to the micro-courses used).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this solution for training, the main advantage of this solution is its simplicity. It will not use a large number of complex analysis methods or the creation of synthetic variables (such notebooks can be found in sufficient quantities) - this solution is aimed at obtaining decent model accuracy using the basic principles. Thus, you will be able to see the simple logic of data processing and model building.üëç\n",

    "### How do I get started on the Kaggle platform?\n",
    "First, I would like to leave here my subjective view of the order of studying Kaggle micro-courses. In my opinion, these micro-courses are incredibly practical. You can stop anywhere, on any line code in a particular course and start your own exploration on the selected dataset. You can find a complete list of micro-courses available on this platform [here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).\n",
    "### <br/> Here we go:\n",
    "1. [Hello, Python!](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)\n",
    "<br/> One of the main programming languages used in Data Science is Python. The presented course can be started to study even with a zero level of knowledge of the programming language. Actually, it was from this level that I started learning Python.üòä\n",
    "The course is really interesting, and the practical tasks are really challenging.üí™\n",
    "2. [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)\n",
    "<br/> While Python is the most popular programming language in the data science world, *Pandas* is the most popular Python library for data analysis. In this course, you can learn more about the functions and methods applicable to data frames. How to create a table, how to extract the necessary information from it, and much more.\n",
    "3. [Data-visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization)\n",
    "<br/> In this micro-course, you will learn the basics of data visualization using the *Seaborn* library. The presented course describes in great detail all the tools necessary for work, explaining literally every word in a line of code to you! It is also a very colorful course, because the resulting visuals look amazingly interesting. You can master data visualization without the first two micro-courses, but nevertheless, I recommend that you first study the base of the programming language. Data visualization is very interesting and, if used wisely, can reveal interesting dependencies, tell a previously unknown story about the presented data.\n",
    "4. [Intro-to-machine-learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)\n",
    "<br/> This course introduces us to the basic machine learning models that we need to predict key values. The course provides an introduction to classification and regression models such as: *Decision Tree Model* and *Random Forest*. Here we will also get acquainted with the problem of *underfitting* and *overfitting* models, methods of assessing its accuracy. Of course, this micro-course will not give you the mathematical foundations of the presented methods, but as I said earlier, this is pure practice.‚ú® You can immediately apply these models to real data!\n",
    "5. [Intermediate-machine-learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)\n",
    "<br/> This course is also a must, as it raises critical issues that are encountered in real-world data. In the Titanic problem, we will encounter data gaps, as well as categorical variables that our model does not want to perceive in their pure form.üôÑ In this course, you will also learn about *pipelines*, advanced model checking techniques (*cross-validation*), the problem of *data leakage*, and explore a new model that is widely used in one form or another in Kaggle's competitions - *XGBoost* üî•.\n",
    "6. [Feature-engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)\n",
    "<br/> I strongly recommend starting this course only after all the previous ones)üòÇ Surely you have seen an important part of any analysis of the problem with the title *Feature Engineering*, but what is it? In fact, this is the creation of new, synthetic variables based on the presented ones, which will improve the predictive performance of the model, as well as increase the interpretability of the results.\n",

    "As we noted earlier, categorical data is contained in the 'Embarked' column. However, the 'Sex' column also contains categorical values. More about how to deal with Categorical Variables can be found in the micro-course [Intermediate-machine-learning. Categorical Variables](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/categorical-variables). In this micro-course, various ways of processing category values are given: simple *Drop* (drop such columns and ignore them), *LabelEncoding* and *OneHotEncoding*. In order to understand the difference between them, be sure to read the presented course. Empirically, I have determined that the best result, in this case, will be when using the *OneHotEncoding* approach to 'Embarked' column and *LabelEncoding* to 'Sex'. However, in order not to use this bulky preprocessing method, I use the alternative *.get_dummies* method (*.factorize()* can be an alternative to *LabelEncoding*). Now let's **preprocess Categorical Variables 'Sex'**:"

    "In this block, we will divide our training data once again into training and test data. More details about this are discussed here: [Intro to Machine Learning. Model Validation](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/model-validation). Short, models can be overfitted and split data allows this to be determined. In this way, we fit the model on a part of the training data, and on the other part we check their accuracy. In the next section, we will fit the model on the selected model on all training data."
